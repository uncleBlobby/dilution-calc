# Dilution Calculator

This tool is designed in conjunction with the CAT APP to provide a rudimentary set of web-apps to ease the daily lives of artisan distillers in Canada.

The purpose is very simple: replace the pen-and-paper scratch-pad method of dilution calculations with a simple and user-friendly web app alternative.

For about six years I have used basic algebra to perform these sorts of calculations, on nearly a daily basis.  Sometimes, like anything else, you
get quite good at it.  Sometimes, I don't even need to do the math (again) because I've done it enough times before that it's burned into my brain.

Other times, you have to do the math -- and that's where this app can come in handy.
