# Dilution Calculator

This tool is designed in conjunction with the CAT APP to provide a rudimentary set of web-apps to ease the daily lives of artisan distillers in Canada.

The purpose is very simple: replace the pen-and-paper scratch-pad method of dilution calculations with a simple and user-friendly web app alternative.

For about six years I have used basic algebra to perform these sorts of calculations, on nearly a daily basis.  Sometimes, like anything else, you
get quite good at it.  Sometimes, I don't even need to do the math (again) because I've done it enough times before that it's burned into my brain.

Other times, you have to do the math -- and that's where this app can come in handy.

In order to perform a dilution calculation, typically, we use three known pieces of information to calculate one unknown variable.

Known Variables:
1. Initial Volume of substance.
2. Initial ABV content of substance.
3. Target ABV of end result.

Unknown Variable:

4. Final Volume (and therefore, any volume of required additions).

To use the app, simply enter your starting information (quantity, concentration, and desired output) into the data fields and hit 'Go!'.

The computer will take care of the math, and you can sit back and relax.. at least until it comes time to measure that pesky water (or syrup, flavouring,
whatever else you are using to do your dilution).

Unlike the CAT APP, which is primarily distiller-specific, this dilution calculator can be used by distillers, brewers, winemakers, and anyone else in the club.  I would invite you to give it a try, and see what you think.  It isn't going to change your life drastically -- I hope -- but if you can find a use for it, please be my guest.

Thanks ~
